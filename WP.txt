to set an image for the theme then add an screenshot.png in the theme folder


//to loop on posts and pages
<?php
    while(have_posts()){
        the_post();?>
        <h2><a href="<?php the_permalink(); ?>"><?php the_title(); ?></a></h2>
        <?php the_content(); ?>
        <hr>
        <?php
    }
?>
//to loop on a single page use same code in single.php same code as above
//to loop on a single page use same code in page.php
//if these 2 pages above doesn't exist then by default wp will use index.php

//for header and footer
make files called header.php and footer.php
and call get_header() and get_footer() respectively
call wp_head() in the head section to load css and js files
//to start the path from the theme path use
<?php echo get_theme_file_uri("/images/library-hero.jpg") ?>

in the functions.php:
function university_files() {
//loading js file requires 5 arguments, first 2 are same as the css file
//3rd arg to include dependencies(NULL if no dependencies)
//4th arg is for version number
//5th argument is whether we want to load the file right before the closing body tag(true for yes so it loads it there instead of head section)

    wp_enqueue_style('university_main_styles',get_stylesheet_uri()); //to load styles.css use get_stylesheet_uri()
}
call add_action('wp_enqueue_scripts','university_files') in the fuctions.php page to load css and js files
note: wp_enqueue_style to load css and wp_enqueue_script to load js
wp_enqueue_style means right before you output this line of code load university_files




Section 5:


to allow wp to set a title for every page use
function university_features(){
    add_theme_support('title-tag');// to enable a feature for the theme
}
add_action('after_setup_theme','university_features');

for links we use site_url which automatically gives you the root directory of your website
href="<?php echo site_url('/?page_id=12') ?>"



to get the current/parent page ids//it 
$the_parent = wp_get_post_parent_id(get_the_ID());
//the parent will give 0 if there is no parent
to get the permalink of a certain page
echo get_permalink($the_parent)

if a wp function begins with get the it will give you a value and not echo anything for you
if a fn begins with the word the then wp will handle echoing and outputing on to the page
the_title()     get_the_title()
the_ID()     get_the_ID()

to look for wp functions
https://codex.wordpress.org/
https://developer.wordpress.org/

view all pages with current and children pages
wp_list_pages();



if($the_parent){
              $findChildrenOf = $the_parent;
          }
          else{
              $findChildrenOf = get_the_ID();
          }
wp_list_pages(array(
              'title_li' => NULL,//to remove the title
              'child_of' => $findChildrenOf,//give it the parent ID you want to view its children
              'sort_column' => 'menu_order'//to sort pages depending on the order of the page rather than the alphabatic order
          ));



check if a page is a parent
$testArray = get_pages(array(
        'child_of' =>get_the_ID()
));
note: get_pages is similar to wp_list_pages but the first 1 doesn't echo data for you

for responsive add this in the header
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, intial-scale=1">

to display languages for search engines
<html <?php language_attributes(); ?>>

to tell web browser what kind of characters, letters, and numbers you are going to be using on the page(this depends on the language of the website)
<meta charset="<?php bloginfo('charset') ?>"> //it looks on the language setting and few diff options

this give the body tag some usefull classes
<body <?php body_class(); ?>>


to make the menu dynamic
go to the function.php and add this function
register_nav_menu('headerMenuLocation', 'header Menu Location');// it should be called on during after_setup_theme hook or event
and in the page.php
<?php
wp_nav_menu(array(
    'theme_location' =>'headerMenuLocation'
    ));
    ?>

to give color to the current like
if(is_page('about-us') or wp_get_post_parent_id(get_the_ID()) == 12 ) //the or condition is for the children pages
btw you can remove get_the_ID() and replace it by 0 and the function will know that you mean current page
<li <?php if(is_page('about-us')) echo 'class="current-menu-item"' ?>
